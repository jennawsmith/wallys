Now you need to get your beautifully designed flyers into the hands of the right people. Here are five different ways to distribute your event flyers,Â both off- and online:

<b>1. Local shops and services</b>

This is the most traditional way to get your flyers out into the world. Ask local businesses if theyâ€™ll post them in their shop windows or out on display tables. Look for places with a waiting room where people spend time with not much to do: hairdressers, opticians, dentists, etc.

Of course, you want to place your flyers in businesses that cater to the crowd you want to attract to your event. Do a little research to find local businesses that may be of interest to your target audience. You may even want to send outÂ <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/academy/event-survey-webinar/">a survey</a>Â to ask potential attendees what neighborhoods or shops they spend the most time in. Chances are, other people with similar interests frequent these same places.

Consider offering to display flyers for their business at your event in exchange for their promotional help.

<b>2. Direct mail</b>

While a more expensive option, you can always mail out your event invitations.

Assuming you already have a list of potential attendees and their addresses, all you need to do is send them off. If youâ€™re on a limited budget (or only want to mail a small number of invitations), then you can print off labels and stuff the envelopes yourself.

If youâ€™re sending out a larger quantity, a mailing house can typically handle this for you. You can find mailing houses near you with a simple Google search. Their cost usually depends on how many flyers youâ€™re mailing, and most services will create a custom quote for you. (So donâ€™t forget, you can always negotiate!)

Donâ€™t have the addresses you need? Try applying to USPS for targeted flyer delivery. Through theirÂ <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">â€œEvery Door Direct Mailâ€ program</a>, you can map your marketing mail audience by age, income, or household size. You can also use their mapping tool to target a specific ZIP code and carrier route.

<b>3. Door drops</b>

One cheap way to distribute your flyers without an address list is to deliver them yourself, also known as a â€œdoor drop.â€ This is a time-intensive process that doesnâ€™t allow you to cover a wide geographical area, but it can work if your distribution is hyper-targeted.

For example, if youâ€™re targeting students, then you can head to a nearby campus or work an area with a dense student population. No mailing addresses needed!

If you want to try this tactic on a larger scale, you can always hire help to distribute your leaflets. A company likeÂ <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/?utm_source=ggl_cpc&amp;utm_medium=taskrabbit&amp;utm_campaign=Google_Search_SF_Alpha_Brand&amp;gclid=COjG_bGJ1M8CFQ5Efgod2ewCGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TaskRabbit</a>Â allows you to employ flexible workers for this kind of job.

<b>4. Bodies on the street</b>

The fourth option is a more proactive approach. You hand potential attendees your flyers in person â€” and might even leave them with a lasting impression!

If youâ€™re on a tight budget, you can hit the streets yourself â€”Â or rope in friends and family to help. Target high foot-traffic areas such as main streets, train or bus stations, sporting facilities, or entertainment complexes.Â As usual, your target audience will dictate the best days, times, and places for you to do this.

If you have more budget than time, then you always have the option of hiring people to do the handouts for you. You can use services likeÂ <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/categories/advertising/handing-out-flyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiverr</a>Â to find a street team that fits your budget.

Before you distribute your flyers on the street, make sure you have the authority to do so. While handing out commercial messaging is mostly protected by the First Amendment, youâ€™ll need permission to distribute your flyers on private property.

<b>5. Online</b>

Of course, you can always distribute your flyer digitally as well!

Pin it on Pinterest, share it on Facebook,Â <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-instagram-stories-for-events-ds00/">Instagram</a>, Snapchat, Twitter, or LinkedIn â€”Â whichever is most appropriate to your audience. If you see your flyer doing particularly well on one channel, consider paying to promote it there for even better results.

Not sure which social channel you should focus on?Â <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/social-media-event-marketing-quiz-ds0c/">Take this quiz to find out</a>!

Embed your flyer on your blog, website, or event page (or better yet, all three) and send it to your friends and connections via email. Ask people to share with anyone that might be interested. The more word-of-mouth marketing you can garner, the better your turnout will be.
